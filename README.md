# Auto-print-mails-on-outlook
# By *Chirag Chopra*

This project was built as a part of my Internship as a Network administrator at Treebo Hotels(Ruptub solutions Pvt. Limited). 
I'm using this script to add to the print rule in Outlook to automatically print email attachments. 
There are several rules added on the format of documents printed and maintain a record to avoid employees printing personal documents and over using the printer. 

This script finds the system's Temp folders, saves any attachments, and runs the Print command for that file.
